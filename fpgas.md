what are fpgas?

basically : field programmable gate arrays # field because it can be reprogrammed on the go on the field if you say so the computer fraternity

now how is it different from traditional processors like amd ryzen 7 its basically a lot of gate units that are arranged in an
array but processors are permanently etched circuit units that are used to in way to process tasks.

butttt... in fgpa you can do stuff parallelly where are the in the processors its boring sequencial stuff.

what is inside an fpga that makes it legennndoryyy...

LUTs - look up tables
register using flip flops more specifically d-flip flops ( now if dont know what d-flip flop is give up your CS degree its of zero value )
